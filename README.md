# Module 02 Mini-Project: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

This webpage project combines HTML, CSS, and JS to develop a webpage while providing insight into CSS snippets that can be used for other applications and services. In fact, most of this webpage is built utilizing these CSS snippets.

## Description

I wanted to work on a project that highlighted some of the coding principles that I have been learning, but also produce a sort of a study guide that I can build on over time. I hope that others that are trying to learn CSS can look at my webpage and also benefit from it.

### Features

I've added two nifty features that are worth digging into a bit more:
* The first is [.click-shadow] and [.click-shadow-fade-out]. These two CSS classes define what I want to happen and are then assigned to a clicked on pre element using JS.
* The second is [.copied-message] and [.copied-message-fade-out]. These two CSS classes work similarly to the above, but provide a 'copied' message to the user when they copy the CSS code in a clicked on pre element.
